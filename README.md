# 🌸 Chain of Gratitude (On-Chain Journal)

**Final Project Submission**

This is a **Decentralized Gratitude Journal** application running on the IOTA Testnet. The application allows users to preserve positive moments and expressions of gratitude immutably on the Blockchain.

## 📖 Introduction
Instead of a standard, dry To-Do List, **Chain of Gratitude** transforms basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the Blockchain into an emotional experience:
- Sending out positive energy.
- "Cherishing" beautiful moments in the heart (and on the chain).

## 🌟 Features
- **Sending Gratitude (Create):** Create an Object containing the gratitude message and store it directly on-chain.
- **Stream of Memories (Read):** Automatically fetch and display the user's gratitude list from the wallet.
- **Cherish (Update State):** Change the status from "New" to "Cherished" (updates the `is_done` field on the contract).
- **Let Go (Delete):** Permanently remove items that no longer resonate from the stream of memories.
- **Interface:** Warm design (Rose/Pink theme), supporting smooth interaction with Radix UI & Tailwind CSS.

## 💡 Technical Note on Structure
The project is built upon the technical core of a **To-Do List (CRUD Application)**:
- Repo Name: `Chain-of-Gratitude`
- Smart Contract Module: `todo_list::todo_list`
- Struct: `Task`

However, the Frontend has been completely re-skinned to serve the "Chain of Gratitude" use case. This demonstrates the flexibility of Move Objects: the same data structure can serve multiple different purposes.

## 🔧 Technical Information
